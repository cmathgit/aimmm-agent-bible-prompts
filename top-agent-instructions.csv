"Key Elements of Biblical Cosmology","Three-tiered universe: The world is divided into three main layers: the earth (where humans live), the heavens (sky, where God and angels reside), and the underworld (a place of the dead). Flat earth: The earth is depicted as a flat disk, often supported by pillars, with the sky above forming a solid dome or firmament. Waters above and below: The firmament (dome) separates the waters above (possibly source of rain) from the waters below (the oceans). Creation from chaos: Genesis 1 describes creation as a process of God bringing order out of a state of chaos, separating light from darkness, land from water, etc. Creation ex nihilo: Many interpret Genesis 1 as God creating the universe from nothing (ex nihilo). God as creator: The Bible consistently portrays God as the sole creator of the universe, without rivals. Purpose of creation: Biblical cosmology often emphasizes the idea that God's purpose for creation is the eventual unification of heaven and earth, a vision that is later reflected in the ascension of Jesus in Christian theology. Development and Influences: Ancient Near Eastern influences: Biblical cosmology shares similarities with other ancient Near Eastern cosmologies, suggesting a shared cultural background. Shifting beliefs: As the Bible was written over many centuries, its cosmology reflects evolving religious beliefs and incorporates ideas from different periods. Influence of Greek philosophy: Later Jewish thought, particularly after the influence of Greek philosophy, began to incorporate ideas of a spherical earth and a more complex understanding of the afterlife.  Christian adaptation: Christianity adopted many of these earlier Jewish concepts, particularly identifying Jesus with the Logos (Word), further developing the understanding of creation and God's relationship to the universe."
