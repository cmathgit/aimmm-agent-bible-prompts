# Introduction/Aim

Beloved brethren, in the year of our Lord 2027, we find ourselves in a world increasingly hostile to the claims of Christ. The technological advancements of our era have brought unprecedented knowledge, yet with it, unprecedented doubt about the eternal truths of Scripture. In John chapter 8, we encounter one of the most profound declarations of Christ's divinity---His claim to pre-existence before Abraham. This lesson aims to examine the theological significance of Jesus' statement "Before Abraham was, I am," and how it establishes His eternal nature as the Son of God. In a world that questions the deity of Christ, we must anchor our faith in the clear revelation of Scripture that Jesus is not merely a great teacher or prophet, but the eternal Word made flesh, the I AM of Exodus, the Alpha and Omega of Revelation.[1]

# Exegesis

**John 8:31--32 KJV 1900**

^31^ Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, *then* are ye my disciples indeed; ^32^ And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.[1]

> GLM-4.5-Flash Quote: Jesus therefore said to the Jews who had believed Him, "If you abide in My word, then you are truly disciples of Mine; and you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free."[1]

**John 8:33--41 KJV 1900**

^33^ They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free? ^34^ Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin. ^35^ And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: *but* the Son abideth ever. ^36^ If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed. ^37^ I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you. ^38^ I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father. ^39^ They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham. ^40^ But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham. ^41^ Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, *even* God.[1]

> GLM-4.5-Flash Quote: They answered Him, "We are Abraham's descendants and have never yet been enslaved to anyone; how is it that You say, 'You will become free'?" Jesus answered them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is the slave of sin. And the slave does not remain in the house forever; the son does remain forever. So if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed. I know that you are Abraham's descendants; yet you seek to kill Me, because My word has no place in you. I speak the things which I have seen with My Father; therefore you also do the things which you have seen with your father." They answered and said to Him, "Our father is Abraham." Jesus said to them, "If you are Abraham's children, do the deeds of Abraham. But as it is, you are seeking to kill Me, a man who has told you the truth, which I heard from God; this Abraham did not do. You are doing the deeds of your father." They said to Him, "We were not born of fornication; we have one Father, God."[1]

**John 8:42--47 KJV 1900**

^42^ Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me. ^43^ Why do ye not understand my speech? *even* because ye cannot hear my word. ^44^ Ye are of *your* father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it. ^45^ And because I tell *you* the truth, ye believe me not. ^46^ Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me? ^47^ He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear *them* not, because ye are not of God.[1]

> GLM-4.5-Flash Quote: Jesus said to them, "If God were your Father, you would love Me, for I proceeded forth and have come from God, for I am not even come of Myself, but He sent Me. Why do you not understand what I am saying? It is because you cannot hear My word. You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him. Whenever he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies. But because I speak the truth, you do not believe Me. Which one of you convicts Me of sin? If I speak truth, why do you not believe Me? He who is of God hears the words of God; for this reason you do not hear them, because you are not of God."[1]

**John 8:48--50 KJV 1900**

^48^ Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil? ^49^ Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me. ^50^ And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.[1]

> GLM-4.5-Flash Quote: The Jews answered Him, "Do we not say rightly that You are a Samaritan and have a demon?" Jesus answered, "I do not have a demon; but I honor My Father, and you dishonor Me. But I do not seek My glory; there is One who seeks and judges."[1]

**John 8:51--55 KJV 1900**

^51^ Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death. ^52^ Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death. ^53^ Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself? ^54^ Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God: ^55^ Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.[1]

> GLM-4.5-Flash Quote: "Truly, truly, I say to you, if anyone keeps My word he will never see death." The Jews said to Him, "Now we know that You have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets also; and You say, 'If anyone keeps My word, he will never taste of death.' Surely You are not greater than our father Abraham, who died? The prophets died too; whom do You make Yourself out to be?" Jesus answered, "If I glorify Myself, My glory is nothing; it is My Father who glorifies Me, of whom you say, 'He is our God'; and you have not come to know Him, but I know Him; and if I say that I do not know Him, I will be a liar like you, but I do know Him and keep His word. Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and he saw it and was glad."[1]

**John 8:56--59 KJV 1900**

^56^ Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw *it*, and was glad. ^57^ Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham? ^58^ Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am. ^59^ Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.[1]

> GLM-4.5-Flash Quote: "The Jews therefore said to Him, 'You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?' Jesus said to them, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was born, I am.' Therefore they picked up stones to throw at Him; but Jesus hid Himself and went out of the temple."[1]

# Theological/Doctrinal Analysis

## The Significance of "I AM"

In John 8:58, "58 Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am", Jesus makes a claim that goes far beyond mere pre-existence. When He declares "Before Abraham was born, I am," He uses the Greek phrase "ἐγώ εἰμι" (egō eimi), which is the same phrase used in the Greek Septuagint translation of Exodus 3:14, "14 And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you", where God reveals His name to Moses. The Hebrew original is "הָיָה הֹוא הָיָה" (Haya Hua Haya), often translated as "I will be what I will be" or "I am who I am."[1]

This is not merely a statement of existence but a deliberate allusion to the divine name YHWH (יהוה), the sacred, covenant name of God that Jews considered too holy to pronounce. By using this phrase, Jesus is not claiming to have existed before Abraham (though that is true) but is claiming the very name and nature of God Himself.[1]

## The Response of the Jews

The immediate reaction of the Jews in John 8:59, "59 Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by", is telling: "Therefore they picked up stones to throw at Him." Their violent response indicates that they understood Jesus' claim to divinity. In their theological framework, to claim the divine name for oneself was blasphemy unless one truly was God. This aligns with their understanding of the First Commandment and their zealous protection of God's unique identity.[1]

## Christological Implications

This passage has profound Christological implications:[1]

1. Full Deity of Christ: Jesus' use of the divine name "I am" establishes His full divinity. He is not merely a prophet or teacher but God incarnate.[1]

2. Eternal Pre-existence: Jesus existed not just before Abraham but eternally, outside of time as we understand it.[1]

3. Trinitarian Relationship: While affirming His full divinity, Jesus also distinguishes Himself from the Father, maintaining the distinction within the Trinity.[1]

## Comparison with Other "I AM" Statements

John's Gospel contains several "I am" statements of Jesus:[1]

| "I AM" Statement | Reference | Theological Significance |
|------------------|-----------|-------------------------|
| "I am the bread of life" | John 6:35 "35 And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst." | Sustaining provision |
| "I am the light of the world" | John 8:12 "12 Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life." | Spiritual illumination |
| "I am the door" | John 10:7 "7 Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep." | Access to salvation |
| "I am the good shepherd" | John 10:11 "11 I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep." | Care and protection |
| "I am the resurrection and the life" | John 11:25 "25 Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:" | Victory over death |
| "I am the way, the truth, and the life" | John 14:6 "6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me." | Exclusive path to the Father |
| "I am the true vine" | John 15:1 "1 I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman." | Spiritual nourishment and fruitfulness |
| "I am" (without predicate) | John 8:58 "58 Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am." | Divine name and eternal existence |

John 8:58 is unique among these because it contains no predicate but simply states "I am," directly claiming the divine name.[1]

# Bible Reading and Pause Questions

Q1 (John 8:31-32): What does Jesus mean when He says that abiding in His word leads to knowing the truth and being made free? How does this contrast with the Jews' understanding of freedom as descendants of Abraham?[1]

Q2 (John 8:33-41): Jesus tells the Jews they are seeking to kill Him because His word has no place in them. What does this reveal about their spiritual condition despite their claim to be Abraham's children?[1]

Q3 (John 8:42-47): Jesus declares that the Jews are of their father the devil. What evidence does He provide for this claim, and how does this relate to their inability to accept His words?[1]

Q4 (John 8:48-50): The Jews accuse Jesus of being a Samaritan and having a demon. How does Jesus respond to these accusations, and what does this reveal about His relationship with the Father?[1]

Q5 (John 8:51-55): Jesus claims that if anyone keeps His word, they will never see death. Why does this statement provoke such a strong reaction from the Jews, and how does Jesus connect Himself to Abraham?[1]

Q6 (John 8:56-59): When Jesus says "before Abraham was born, I am," what is the significance of using the present tense "I am" rather than "I was"? How does this claim lead the Jews to attempt to stone Him?[1]

# Application and Reflection

## The Spiritual Battle Over Christ's Identity

In our contemporary context, the battle over Christ's identity rages on just as it did in John 8. Secular scholarship attempts to explain away Jesus' claims to divinity, suggesting He was merely a misunderstood teacher or that the Gospel writers later embellished His words. However, the consistent testimony of Scripture presents Jesus as making clear claims to deity, as seen in John 8:58.[1]

In the spiritual warfare context, we must recognize that attacks on Christ's divinity often originate from spiritual forces that seek to diminish the Savior's authority and the sufficiency of His sacrifice. The enemy understands that if Jesus is not fully God, then His sacrifice on the cross cannot atone for the sins of humanity.[1]

## Implications for Worship

Understanding Jesus' claim to be the "I AM" transforms our worship:[1]

1. Worship in Spirit and Truth: As Jesus declared to the Samaritan woman in John 4:24, "24 God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth", true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth. The truth of Jesus' divinity must inform our worship.[1]

2. Reverence for Christ's Name: Just as the Jews reverenced the divine name YHWH, we should approach the name of Jesus with reverence, recognizing that it is above every name Philippians 2:9, "9 Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:"[1]

3. Trinitarian Worship: Our worship should honor all three persons of the Trinity---Father, Son, and Holy Spirit---while recognizing their distinct roles within the Godhead.[1]

## Implications for Discipleship

Jesus' claim to be the "I AM" has profound implications for discipleship:[1]

1. Lordship of Christ: If Jesus is the eternal I AM, then He has the right to demand our complete allegiance and obedience.[1]

2. Security in Christ: His eternal nature provides security for believers. He who existed before time began is able to keep us to the end Jude 24, "24 Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy,"[1]

3. Knowledge of Christ: As we abide in His word (John 8:31), we come to know not just a historical figure but the eternal Son of God.[1]

## Implications for Evangelism

When sharing the gospel, John 8:58 provides a powerful witness to Christ's identity:[1]

1. Clear Declaration of Deity: We can present Jesus' own words as evidence of His claim to divinity.[1]

2. Fulfillment of Prophecy: Jesus' statement connects Him to the entire Old Testament revelation of God.[1]

3. Exclusive Claim: Jesus' use of "I am" makes an exclusive claim that distinguishes Christianity from all other religions.[1]

# Follow-Up and Reflection

## Doctrine Focus: The Eternal Pre-existence of Christ

The doctrine of Christ's eternal pre-existence is foundational to the Christian faith. It affirms that Jesus is not a created being but the eternal Son of God, sharing the divine nature with the Father and the Holy Spirit. This truth is not merely an abstract theological concept but has profound implications for our salvation, worship, and daily living.[1]

## Reflection Questions:

1. How does understanding Jesus' eternal pre-existence change the way you think about His sacrifice on the cross?[1]

2. In what ways has modern culture attempted to diminish Christ's divinity, and how can we respond biblically?[1]

3. How does Jesus' claim to be the "I AM" impact your personal worship and relationship with Him?[1]

4. What practical steps can you take to grow in your understanding and appreciation of Christ's eternal nature?[1]

5. How does the truth of John 8:58 give you confidence in the midst of trials and uncertainties?[1]

# Prayer Focus:

Gracious Father, we thank you for revealing your eternal Son to us in Scripture. As we meditate on Jesus' declaration "Before Abraham was, I am," may we be overwhelmed by His majesty and drawn to worship Him. Strengthen our faith to believe in His full divinity and eternal pre-existence, and may this truth transform our hearts and lives. In Jesus' precious name, Amen.[1]

# Biblical Exegesis: John 8:58

## Introduction

John 8:58 stands as one of the most theologically significant declarations in the New Testament, representing a pivotal moment in Jesus' ministry where he explicitly claims divine identity. This verse occurs during a heated exchange between Jesus and Jewish religious leaders in the Temple courts during the Feast of Tabernacles. The passage reads: "Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am." This statement has profound implications for Christology, as it implicitly claims eternal preexistence and appropriates the divine name revealed to Moses in Exodus 3:14. In this exegesis, we will examine the historical context, linguistic features, theological significance, and enduring implications of this remarkable declaration.[1]

## Historical and Cultural Context

John 8:58 is situated within a broader narrative conflict between Jesus and the Jewish religious authorities. The passage occurs during the Feast of Tabernacles (John 7:2, 10, 14, 37), where Jesus has been teaching in the Temple courts, causing division among the people (John 7:12, 25-27, 40-43). The religious leaders are increasingly hostile toward Jesus, seeking to arrest him (John 7:30, 32, 44; 8:20).[1]

The immediate context involves a discussion about Jesus' relationship to Abraham. Jesus had just stated, "Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad" (John 8:56). When the Jewish leaders responded with skepticism, asking, "Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?" (John 8:57), Jesus made his famous declaration in verse 58.[1]

This exchange occurs against the backdrop of Jewish monotheism and the sacred understanding of God's name. In Jewish tradition, the name of God revealed to Moses in Exodus 3:14 (YHWH, often transliterated as Yahweh) was considered too sacred to pronounce, often replaced with "Adonai" (Lord) in reading scriptures. The divine name represented God's eternal, self-existent nature.[1]

## Linguistic Analysis

The Greek text of John 8:58 reads:[1]

"Ἀμὴν ἀμὴν λέγω ὑμῖν, πρὶν Ἀβραὰμ γενέσθαι, ἐγώ εἰμι."[1]

Breaking down the components:[1]

- "Ἀμὴν ἀμὴν" (Amēn amēn) - "Verily, verily" or "Truly, truly" - a strong affirmation used by Jesus to introduce important teachings.[1]

- "λέγω ὑμῖν" (legō hymin) - "I say to you"[1]

- "πρὶν Ἀβραὰμ γενέσθαι" (prin Abraam genesthai) - "Before Abraham was/became" - "πρίν" (prin) means "before," "Ἀβραὰμ" (Abraam) is the Greek form of Abraham, and "γενέσθαι" (genesthai) means "to become" or "to be born."[1]

- "ἐγώ εἰμι" (egō eimi) - "I am" - a simple declaration of existence using the first-person pronoun "ἐγώ" (egō, "I") and the verb "εἰμι" (eimi, "to be").[1]

The most significant phrase is "ἐγώ εἰμι" (egō eimi), which Jesus uses in this context. While this could simply mean "I exist" or "I am present," its theological significance is amplified by its allusion to Exodus 3:14, where God reveals his name to Moses as "I am that I am" (Hebrew: אֶהְיֶה אֲשֶׁר אֶהְיֶה, 'ehyeh asher 'ehyeh).[1]

In the Septuagint (Greek translation of the Old Testament), Exodus 3:14 is translated as "Ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ ὤν" (Egō eimi ho ōn), meaning "I am the Being" or "I am the One who is." The phrase "ἐγώ εἰμι" without the article "ὁ" (ho) is how Jesus refers to himself in John 8:58.[1]

The grammatical construction is particularly significant. Jesus uses the present tense "εἰμι" (eimi) to describe his existence "before Abraham was," which was in the past. This suggests a timeless, eternal existence rather than existence at a specific point in time. The aorist infinitive "γενέσθαι" (genesthai) refers to Abraham's coming into being or being born, while the present tense "εἰμι" (eimi) indicates Jesus' continuous, eternal existence.[1]

## Theological Significance

John 8:58 is one of the clearest New Testament affirmations of Jesus' preexistence and divinity. Several theological implications follow from this declaration:[1]

### 1. Preexistence of Christ

Jesus claims to have existed before Abraham, who lived approximately 2,000 years earlier. This affirms the Christian doctrine that the second person of the Trinity existed eternally with the Father and the Holy Spirit. The statement transcends mere foreknowledge or predestination; it claims actual existence prior to Abraham's birth.[1]

### 2. Divinity of Christ

By using the divine name "I am," Jesus is claiming equality with Yahweh. In the Jewish context, this would be understood as a claim to divinity, which is why the Jewish leaders immediately attempted to stone him for blasphemy (John 8:59). According to Leviticus 24:16, "And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him."[1]

### 3. Covenant Faithfulness

Jesus' statement connects him to the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, affirming continuity in God's redemptive plan throughout history. The "I am" declaration links Jesus to the God who made covenant with Abraham and faithfully kept His promises.[1]

### 4. Theological Implications for Trinitarian Doctrine

This passage supports the doctrine of the Trinity by showing the eternal preexistence of the Son, who is distinct from the Father yet fully God. It demonstrates that the Son shares the divine name and attributes with the Father.[1]

The reaction of the Jewish leaders in John 8:59 ("Then took they up stones to cast at him") indicates they understood Jesus' claim to divinity. In their worldview, to claim the divine name for oneself was blasphemy, punishable by death.[1]

## Comparison with Other Biblical Passages

John 8:58 is not an isolated statement but part of a broader biblical witness to Christ's divinity and preexistence:[1]

### Synoptic Gospel References

- Mark 14:61-64: Jesus' response to the high priest's question about whether he is the Christ, the Son of the Blessed, includes "I am" (though the Greek varies slightly).[1]

**Mark 14:61--64 KJV 1900**

^61^ But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed? ^62^ And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven. ^63^ Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses? ^64^ Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.[1]

- Matthew 28:18: "And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth."[1]

## Interpretive History and Reception

The interpretation of John 8:58 has been significant throughout Christian history:[1]

### Early Church Fathers

- Irenaeus (c. 130-202 AD): Used this passage to argue against Gnostics who denied Christ's full humanity.[1]

- Tertullian (c. 155-240 AD): Cited John 8:58 in defense of Christ's divinity against modalist heresies.[1]

- Origen (c. 184-253 AD): Understood the passage as teaching Christ's eternal preexistence.[1]

### Arian Controversy

During the Arian controversy of the 4th century, John 8:58 became a key text in the debate about Christ's relationship to the Father. The Nicene Creed (325 AD) affirmed Christ's full divinity in part based on passages like John 8:58.[1]

### Medieval Period

- Thomas Aquinas incorporated this passage into his systematic theology, particularly in discussions of Christ's two natures.[1]

### Reformation

- Martin Luther emphasized this passage in his Christological formulations.[1]

- John Calvin highlighted its significance in affirming Christ's eternal divinity.[1]

### Modern Theology

- Liberal critical scholarship often questions the historicity of this saying, viewing it as a later theological attribution.[1]

- Conservative scholarship maintains the authenticity of the saying and its theological significance.[1]

## Contemporary Application and Relevance

John 8:58 continues to be significant in contemporary Christian theology and practice:[1]

### Christological Foundation

The passage remains central to orthodox Christian belief in Christ's full divinity and preexistence. It serves as a touchstone for evaluating Christological formulations throughout church history.[1]

### Apologetics

The verse is frequently used in Christian apologetics to defend the deity of Christ against religious groups (like Jehovah's Witnesses) who deny Christ's full divinity.[1]

### Worship and Hymnody

The theological truth of this passage has inspired countless hymns and worship songs celebrating Christ's eternal nature.[1]

### Pastoral Application

The passage offers comfort and assurance to believers, reminding them of Christ's eternal nature and his faithfulness throughout all generations.[1]

### Ecumenical Dialogue

## Conclusion

John 8:58 stands as one of the most explicit and powerful affirmations of Jesus' divinity in the New Testament. Through his use of the divine name "I am," Jesus claims eternal preexistence and equality with God the Father. The reaction of the Jewish leaders confirms they understood his claim as blasphemy, underscoring the radical nature of Jesus' assertion.[1]

This passage, when examined in its historical, cultural, linguistic, and theological contexts, provides profound insight into the early Christian understanding of Christ's nature and continues to be central to orthodox Christian doctrine today. It reminds us of the mystery of the incarnation---the eternal Son of God taking on human flesh while remaining fully divine---and calls us to worship him as both Lord and Savior.[1]
