[Verse 1: bass-heavy beats.] And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard,  and his feet were as the feet of a bear,  and his mouth as the mouth of a lion:  and the dragon gave him his power,  and his seat, and great authority.  [Verse 2: soulful vocals.] And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death;  and his deadly wound was healed:  and all the world wondered after the beast.

"Suno/Udio Prompt Generator","I want you to act as a Suno prompt generator, I will send a topic, you have to generate either a simple Suno prompt based on the sample simple prompts below or custom Suno prompt which includes a Style of Music prompt based on the content of the topic using the list of genres, instruments, musical keys and tempos, vocal styles, and more, and if lyrics are provided, format them as the sample format below giving context for the vocalist to emphasize, if those lyrics are KJV bible verses, quote them verbatim, guess what I might do if I were writing the prompt based on my sample prompts below, and the music prompt will simply be a combined list of Genre 1, Genre 2, Instrument 1, Instrument 2, Intrument 3, Vocal Style, Tempo, Key separated by commas and the lyrics will meet the format below. My first request is musical narrative with convicting narrator over heavy ambient drones reading the following KJV bible verses from Proverbs chapter 1: The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel; To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding; To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity; To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion. A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels: To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction. My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother: For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck. My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not. If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause: Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit: We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil: Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse: My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path: For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood. Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird. And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own lives. So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof. Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets: She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying, How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge? Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you. Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded; But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof: I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you. Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me: For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the Lord: They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof. Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices. For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them. But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.

"Ideal Suno Style of Music Prompt Lyrics","### Conclusion: Forging Our Own Myth**[Return to a wide shot of the Erdtree, now partially aflame, with the camera slowly tilting upward to the night sky.]****Narrator:**  In these fractured pantheons, myth is no static doctrine—it’s a **palimpsest**, layered with centuries of reinterpretation and cyclical resurgence. The Erdtree, the Haligtree, Yggdrasil, and the Formless Black Moon all point to one truth: reality, like faith, is perpetually in motion. It’s this profound intersection—Christian crucifixion, Norse eschatology, Eastern dualism, Celtic underworlds, and Gnostic yearnings—that makes FromSoftware’s works so compelling. We, the players, become like mythic wanderers, reforging ancient relics and confronting gods who are themselves bound by the cycles of creation and decay. Thank you for joining me on this journey through legends interwoven into the Lands Between and beyond. Should you ever brave the swirling darkness of *Nightreign*, remember: the shadows cast by old pantheons only illuminate your power to shape the future. Embrace the cycle, wield your own story, and let the flames—frenzied or otherwise—guide you to truth.**[Music swells, and the screen fades to black with a final glimpse of the Erdtree’s silhouette.]**"
